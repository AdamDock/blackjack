Start with 5000 chips and try your luck in this casino game!
Steps
1.) Place a bet by clicking on the chips. Click reset if you need to restart.
2.) Click Deal to be dealt a hand and the dealer will be dealt a hand as well.
3.) Click Hit to be dealt another card. You can hit as many times as you want until you bust or stand. You also have the option to double and split. A double is when you have your initial hand and you double your bet and get one more card. A split is when you have two cards of the same rank and you split them into two hands and maintain your bet for both hands.
4.) Click Stand to end your turn. The dealer will then play their hand. The dealer must hit if they have a score of 16 or less and must stand if they have a score of 17 or more.
5.) If you win, you will win your bet. If you lose, you will lose your bet. If you get blackjack, you will win 1.5x your bet.
6.) If you run out of chips, you lose the game.
