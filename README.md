Start with 5000 chips and try your luck in this casino game!
Steps
1.) Place a bet by clicking on the chips. Click reset if you need to restart.
2.) Click Deal to be dealt a hand and the dealer will be dealt a hand as well.
3.) Click Hit to be dealt another card. You can hit as many times as you want until you bust or stand. You also have the option to double and split. A double is when you have your initial hand and you double your bet and get one more card. A split is when you have two cards of the same rank and you split them into two hands and maintain your bet for both hands.
4.) Click Stand to end your turn. The dealer will then play their hand. The dealer must hit if they have a score of 16 or less and must stand if they have a score of 17 or more.
5.) If you win, you will win your bet. If you lose, you will lose your bet. If you get blackjack, you will win 1.5x your bet.
6.) If you run out of chips, you lose the game.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
